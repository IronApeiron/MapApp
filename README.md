# MapApp
This is a compact and unique app where the goal is this: anything that can be done with a digital map can be done here. These extensions of the app are called plugins, and eventually, other Android developers can create their own and perhaps monetize it too! This is a work in progress.

Overall Progress [52% to Alpha Build]
